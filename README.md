# WindAnomaly
C++ app used to help researchers detect numerical anomalies

# Setup
No setup required. Just have a data.csv with the correct data in the same directory. This repository contains the test data used during initial testing

1. clone repo
2. g++ -std=c++11 ./main.cpp -o winddata
3. ./windata

## Future updates
I will add the graphing later. Initial use was for analysis only, Excel was used to generate graphs.
